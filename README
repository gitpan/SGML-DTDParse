DTDParse v2.00
==============

DTDParse is a tool for processing SGML and XML DTDs. The primary
motivation for writing DTDParse was to provide a framework for
building documentation for DTDs, but other applications are easy
to imagine.

Using DTDParse is a two-step process. First the DTD is parsed
with 'dtdparse'. This produces an XML version of the DTD.
Subsequent processing is performed against this XML version.

More information about DTDParse is available in the SGML::DTDParse
manual page.


INSTALLATION

To install this package type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

You may need administrative priviledges to do the above.

If you want to install in a separate location from perl's default,
you can do something like the following:

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/path/to/install


DOCUMENTATION

Manpages are included in the DTDParse installation.  They can
be accessed like any other Perl module or command.  For example,

  perldoc SGML::DTDParse

If you want to read the documentation before installation, you
can generate HTML documentation by typing the following after
running 'perl Makefile.PL' described above:

  make htmldoc

HTML documentation will be available in doc/html.

DTDParse modules and scripts require these other modules and libraries:

Getopt::Long
Text::DelimMatch
